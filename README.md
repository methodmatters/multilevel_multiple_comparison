# Data and code for blog post on multi-level models / multiple comparisons

The content here accompanies the following blog post:

https://methodmatters.github.io/transfer-learning-influential-rap-albums/

The data are in the "Data" directory and the code in the "Scripts" directory. Note slight changes in the code (vs. the blog post) due to the fact that this script now loads the data from a .csv file (some of the "type" meta-data was lost in the conversion from R data to csv format).

Comments, suggestions, improvements are welcome!
